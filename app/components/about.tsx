      I&apos;m Tiffania, a proud blend of Italian and Malagasy heritage
      currently residing in New Jersey. Following the pursuit of a
      bachelor&apos;s degree in Intercultural Mediation and Languages, my
      journey took an intriguing turn when my brother introduced me to the
      realms of{" "}

          SEO, copywriting
        </a>
      </strong>
      , and eventually, software development. As I delved into crafting elements
      with HTML and CSS, my curiosity ignited, propelling me to explore the vast
      possibilities within the realm of coding. This passion culminated in my
      participation in a{" "}

      , where I acquired skills in{" "}
      <strong className="text-green-400">Javascript, React, Express</strong>,
      and more. <br />
      <br />
      Being inherently curious, my quest for knowledge extends across diverse
      subjects, as I firmly believe that understanding fosters conscious
      decision-making. Not surprisingly, one of my favorite hobbies is reading!
      Additionally, I find joy in crocheting, strolling in nature, and
      experimenting in the kitchenâ€”melding different aromas to create a unique
      flavor. This multifaceted approach to life reflects my belief in embracing
      variety and continually evolving.
